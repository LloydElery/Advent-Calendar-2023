# Advent of Code | 2023

## INFO

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that presents participants with a series of small programming puzzles to solve. These puzzles cater to a variety of skill levels and can be tackled in any programming language. The event takes the form of an Advent calendar, with a new puzzle being revealed each day in December leading up to Christmas.

Participants use the puzzles for various purposes, including interview preparation, skill enhancement, company training, and as a friendly competition with others. Solvers do not necessarily need a computer science background; basic programming knowledge and problem-solving skills are sufficient.

The event encourages users to share their solutions, discuss approaches, and collaborate on problem-solving strategies. It's an engaging and fun way to challenge oneself and improve programming abilities.
